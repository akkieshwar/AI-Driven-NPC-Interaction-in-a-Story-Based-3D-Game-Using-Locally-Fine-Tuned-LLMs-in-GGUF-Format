## Project Overview

**Elira-NPC-LLM** is an open-source, local Large Language Model for building deeply emotional NPC dialogue in any game.  
- Built on [Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2)
- Fine-tuned on 500+ lines of handcrafted, emotion-tagged conversation
- Exports to GGUF for blazing-fast local inference (llama.cpp, Ollama, etc)
- Modular code: train, merge, inference, dataset, and conversion steps
